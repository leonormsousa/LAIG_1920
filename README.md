# LAIG_1920

### Description
The objective of this course is to develop a set of practical skills, some of them already tough in above courses. This course is focused in development practical works, multidisciplinary as possible, namely in the areas of Computer Graphics and Interfaces, Logic Programming, Operating Systems.
It is also an objective to give the students the capacity to develop software, namely in the creation of 3D environments (polygonal representation, illumination and interaction) and in the use of services offered by the operating system, with emphasis in communications and synchronization.

#### Test Grade: 20.0

### Project 1
It is intended, with this work, to constitute an application equipped with a small 3D graphic engine. The application must be able to produce images of any scene, which is specified through a text file to be read by the application. The text file must respect its own scheme, which we will call LXS - LAIG XML Scene graph - specified in section 3 of this document, and which follows a very common concept in computer graphics: the Scene Graph (Scene Graph, section 2) . The syntax follows the XML (Extensible Markup Language) tag format. The application must, through a parser, read an LXS document (whose file extension must be .xml) that describes the scene, simultaneously building the data structure corresponding to the scene graph. Only then should the respective image be generated. The light sources must start (on/off) in accordance with the LXS specification and must be changeable using controls in the 2D GUI. The selection of the active view is also done through a list available in the 2D graphical interface.

#### Final Grade: 19.1

### Project 2
The objective of this work is to explore graphic techniques such as NURBS (Non-uniform Rational B-spline), keyframe animation and the use of Render-to-texture techniques, using shaders based on GLSL ES (OpenGL for Embedded Systems' Shading Language). Thus, it is proposed the implementation of some functionalities in code, which should be translated into extensions to the LXS language and explored through the creation of a scene that uses them. This document describes the intended features as well as the proposed extensions.

#### Final Grade: 19.8

### Project 3
This document sets out the general aspects to be developed in the graphical interfaces for the games proposed in the Logic Programming discipline. The graphical interface for the game chosen by each group will be developed during the practical classes of the curricular unit Laboratory of Applications with Graphical Interface, using the JavaScript language and using WebGL technology.
#### Final Grade: 19.5

### Final Course Grade: 20
